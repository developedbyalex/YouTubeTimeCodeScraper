# YouTubeTimeCodeScraper
This Python program allows you to retrieve comments from a YouTube video and displays only the comments that contain a time code. It uses the YouTube Data API v3 to fetch the comments associated with a given video link and filters them based on the presence of a time code in the format "MM:SS".
